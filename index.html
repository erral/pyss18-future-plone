          I am Mikel Larreategi and work for CodeSyntax, an internet
          company from Eibar in the Basque Country in norther Spain.

          We are a group of 16 people working on the internet since 2001
          and since the beginning we work with Python.

          We started with plain Zope and back in 2005 started with Plone 2.1.
          After that we have developed sites with all other Plone versions (2.5, 3, 4, and 5)

          Our developers team is more or less 50%-50% of Django and Plone developers
          although we do some other things too (mobile developments with angular
          and ionic, some wordpress...)

        <h2>Why Plone <em>was</em> going to die</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stagnation
          </li>
          <li>
            No plans for Python 3
          </li>
          <li>
            Zope was dead
          </li>
          <li>
            Several leading core-developers left
          </li>
          <li>
            Several features unfinished and unpolished
          </li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          According to Andreas, many things had happend on Plone world lately, such as the coming of
          Dexterty, a new content-type framework, but the Plone community was shrinking.

          Nobody was seeing any progress on the Zope-land (Zope is our application server, on top of that
          is Plone built and we develop applications), there was no plans for Python 3 support, and it
          looked like there was no much effort on evolving Plone.

          Andreas even run a survey just before the conference to know what people thought about Plone, and
          there was people (a majority of tyem) saying that we needed to abandon Zope and use Pyramid.

          Modern JS development with Angular JS and Plone
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We are not modernized enough regarding JS in Plone
          </li>
          <li>
            We keep discussing and changing front-end frameworks

            There is a promising world out there with frameworks like AngularJS
          </li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          On the other side, Timo was more positive than Andreas. He said that the front-end frameworks
          gave as an oportunity to evolve. But to get that, we needed to build a powerful REST API.

          <li>Open Space: plone.restapi: a REST API for Plone</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Timo lead an Open Space in Bucharest where he presented his work on building a powerful REST API
          for Plone. He was finding people to work on that because, like he said in Bristol, he thought that
          this was a real way to prepare to the future for Plone.

          Timo started working on the REST API and the guys from 4 Team work in Switzerland provided great features
          such as compatibility for the old content-type framework.

          We also provided some developer time and testing, because we had several cases where we needed to
          show content from one site in another, and we found ourselves re-creating APIs to achieve that.

            Basic content-type information
          </li>
          <li>
            Basic content-negotiation
          </li>
          <li>
            Basic content creation
          </li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          The initial release contained all the basic stuff: content-type representation, basic CRUD operations, login
          and full documentation.

          The aim of the project was to provide a 100% test coverage and documentation for the REST API, and if
          possible, a permanently updated documentation.

        <h2>plone.restapi internals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Content-negotiation:
            <pre>Accept: application/json</pre>
          </li>

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          As you may know in Plone any content-type can be added in any place in the content-tree. So it has no
          sense to create an endpoint to return all the "News Items" or "Pages" or "Files" of the site.

          Moreover we don't do rounting for our URLs. We do not have URL patterns to follow, so we need another
          way to build API urls.

          To achieve that Timo came up with a solution: use Content-Negotiation. This is an HTTP standard which says
          that when querying any URL you can ask in which format do you want to have the response.

          And what can we do with this for the future of Plone?
          A react-based front-end for Plone.

          You may know the Gutenberg project for Wordpress, which provides a new full-JS editor
          for WordPress. Volto is the idea to have something similar for Plone. This way we decouple
          all the Plone editing interface from the CMS, and add a way to customize in an easier way.

          For us in the Plone world is sometimes hard to get front-end developers to do front-end-magic
          because we have a very complex stack with many ways to do things and many different ways
          to customize our front-end. With a project like Volto we embrace the front-end world, providing
          a minimal set of tools in a JS framework to ease the development.

          I am not an expert at all on JS and React but Volto is something like that.
